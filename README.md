# RealTimeBusTracker
Overview:

This is my Real Time Bus Tracker project consisting of a .html, .js and .css file. The aim of the project is to produce a Bus Tracker which shows the multiple stops along the bus route between the MIT and Harvard campuses.

Roadmap:

In the future I would like to improve this program even more and introduce a 'live tracking' element whereby a user can track multiple different buses in real time. I would also like to consider the commercial applications of such a program.
